A Bitcoin-themed grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## Overview

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. There are so many versions of it it is hard to in down it's exact origin. There are claims that the famous writer of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain invented his own version. I googled it and whatever it is, it looks more like a way of trying to figure out how much tax you owe rather than match cards.
### Rules

You will start by flipping over one card
If the next card you flip matches, a popup alert notifies you and you get +1 to your score
These cards then disappear
If the next card you flip does not match, a popup alert notifies you of this and the cards flip back
The game continues until you match all the cards on the board
